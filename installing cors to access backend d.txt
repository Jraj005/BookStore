installing cors to access backend data in frontend while backend is also running. CORS is a middleware used in index.js file 

we are parsing the data using index.js file to send the data into database.
but there is a problem we can clearly see the password in the database which is threating the security of user's details
To secure password we will use bcryptjs, first we will install it using npm, we will create a const hashPassword=bcryptjs.hash(password,10) and pass it into createdUser object.
here 10 is scale of security, we can also use 8.
we use "Promise" concept of javascript for the authentication and signup part.
Also need to write await before isMatch const in user controller, to wait for data to come.


Till now we have successfully made the login and signup feature but it is using input from postman, to get data directly from frontend we have to edit the code. 
in the signup.jsx , create a onsubmit const, which takes data from the data object passed. then use axios to call api to store data in database

After signup we want to store the information of user into browser's localstorage, to give access to course section which is allowed to only registered users only.
we can use data from localstorage using context API.

using React hot toast: to make popup when login is successful instead of giving alert.


PROBLEM: after signup it does not auto reload, have to solve.
